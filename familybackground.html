<h1>DACLES FAMILY</h1>
<font color=black>
<p>Our family usually spends time together by playing basketball, watching movies, and cooking. We are open in every problem that each of us encounters so that each of us can offer advice. We assisted each other in making decisions so that none of us would be harmed. We simply adore our family. We believe that, "The family that prays together, stays together,". </p>
