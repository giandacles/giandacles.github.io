<h3>Playing Basketball</h3>
<p>Basketball has an impact on both physical and mental health. When I'm stressed, I go to the court and play with my friends, and the stress disappears. Basketball serves as a stress reliever for me. Basketball has helped me improve my motor coordination, flexibility, and endurance. It also promotes quickness, agility, and strength. These abilities have been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and self-esteem by promoting a healthy body weight and encouraging more physical activity.</p>

<h3>Watching Movies</h3>
<p>I gained a lot from watching movies. It serves as a family bonding experience, which has made me more family oriented. Some of the films I've seen have inspired me to be a better person and helped me deal with difficult situations. In addition, watching movies improves my vocabulary and communication skills.</p>
