<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>I've loved eating since I was a child because my mother's prepared foods were always delicious. I was always watching her as she prepared the food we ate, and from her I learned the various recipes and cooking techniques she used. As of now, I'm one of our house's chefs, preparing delicious meals for the family.</p>

<h3>Wiring Installation</h3>
<p>When I was in junior high school, my TLE course was Electricity. The electricity lesson was extremely difficult because there are many symbols and connections to memorize, but because of my hard work and determination, I memorized all of it as well as different types of wirings and received a high grade. I applied all of my knowledge to our home by simply repairing all of the broken wiring and reconnecting various connections. If there is a connection and wiring problem, we will not have to wait long for our father to return home.</p>
